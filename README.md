## About this Repository
This repository contains the game Nine Men's Morris, also known as Mills, programmed in Python. Players have the option to compete against each other or against an Artificial Intelligence (AI). The AI offers three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. It utilizes a depth-limited Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm, where the depth is dynamically determined based on the game state to control response time variance. Each difficulty level uses different game state evaluation functions.

## Library Requirements
